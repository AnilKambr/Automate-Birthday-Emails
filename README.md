# Automate-Birthday-Emails
The "Automate Birthday Emails/SMS" project leverages Python and the smtplib library to automatically send personalized birthday greetings via email or SMS. This system reads user data from a CSV file, checks for birthdays, and sends customized messages to the recipients on their special day.
